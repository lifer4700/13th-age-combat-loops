# 13th-age-combat-loops
Plays 7 different sounds, one for each value of the Escalation Die.

## Prerequisite
You **must** create a playlist named "13th Age Combat Loops" and populate that list with 7 sounds with the following names:  
- "Escalation 0 Loop"
- "Escalation 1 Loop"
- "Escalation 2 Loop"
- "Escalation 3 Loop"
- "Escalation 4 Loop"
- "Escalation 5 Loop"
- "Escalation 6 Loop"

Set the Playlist's "Playback Mode" to "Soundboard Only"  
For each Sound, toggle "Loop Sound" on.  
I recommend a Fade Duration of 500 ms.

### Notes
I chose those sound names to correspond to the track names of the Official 13th Age soundtrack, but you can use any sounds you like as long as they have these names.
